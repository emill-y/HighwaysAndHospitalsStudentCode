Determined that the crux of the problem is assigning seperate clusters, and giving each cluster a hospital. Visualizing the enviorment is the most critical element of the problem. During class I thought of storing an array, of arraylists, so each city has all of its connections in a list attached to it. I spent a lot of time learning how to implement this, as well as making it a 2d array of objects, with one column array lists, and the other column booleans of "is connected to a hospital", however it's still really hard to connect the seperate clusters. |

If 4->5 comes up, create a new group. I commented out this plan and then decided to spend the rest of my time trying to implement this algo. |

However, this didn't work when I ran it, which I realized was because there was no good way to merge seperate connected clusters that were created -> meaning there were a ton more clusters created than possible. It would be nice if there was an efficient way to find and merge connected clusters. |
| Sep 12 |       4:45 - 5:37       | Decided to scrap the convoluted array list of array lists, and thought about what data structure might be good for "merging". Then I realized whenever there is a merge problem, the opposite is kind of a tree, where instead of merging, it seperates. I also remember learning about a sorting algorithm that used recursion to join together pairs. I decided to use this idea, where each city starts as an individual node, and then, they are paired up when there are connections (kind of like a tree that starts at the leaves, and move together to form seperate roots). When implementing this, I was able to get clusters working, and soon realized, that if I fully combined the branches of the tree so they mapped to the same root, the code actually gets more efficient at clustering as it continues. Then, I have seperate clusters where all I have to do is add one hospital, as well as one less the number of cities in the cluster highways. This passed the tests, and personally, I think this code is very efficient, especially since the runtime doesn't increase THAT drastically for larger tests... At least it's more effieicnt than my original array of arraylists idea.. |
